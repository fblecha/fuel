For this example, let's assume you want to start a new blog on dog breeds and you want to put together a site that explains each breed.

Assuming you start in your home directory (for example ~ or /Users/me), then let's assume you want your new site in the ~/dogblog directory.

## Create a new blog

To create that directory you would type:
```shell
$ fuel new dogblog
```
That command tells fuel to create a new installation that's setup for creating your blog.  You'll have the following directories:

~/dogblog/content
~/dogblog/config
~/dogblog/views
~/dogblog/style
