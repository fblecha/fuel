WIP - do not use until there's a release

# haiku
A static blog that can also persist data to a database.

# Purpose

I wanted to create a series of content that would be available by both an API and via a static website, and I didn't want to use wordpress.  Haiku will do two major things:
1. produce a static website
2. for each type of content, persist both the data and metadata into a database

## Databases supported
* (WIP) postgresql
*
## Expected support
- Create new content
- Publish new content
- Save you content to a database
