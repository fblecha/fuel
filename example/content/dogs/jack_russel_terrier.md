The Jack Russell Terrier is a small terrier that has its origins in fox
hunting; it is principally white-bodied and smooth, rough or broken-coated. It
is commonly confused with the Parson Russell terrier (see the American Kennel
Club) and the Russell terrier, which is a shorter-legged, stockier variety.
(Within the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, the "Russell terrier" is also
known as "Jack Russell terrier".) The term "Jack Russell" is commonly misapplied
to other small white terriers.
