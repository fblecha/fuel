The Airedale Terrier (often shortened to "Airedale"), also called Bingley
Terrier and Waterside Terrier, is a dog breed of the terrier type that
originated in the valley (dale) of the River Aire, in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, England. It is traditionally called the "King of Terriers" because it
is the largest of the terrier breeds. The Airedale was bred from a Welsh Terrier
and an Otterhound and probably some other Terrier breeds, originally to hunt
otters. In Britain this breed has also been used as a war dog, guide dog and
police dog.
